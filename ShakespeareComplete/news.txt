select the particular texts you want to search, instead of always
searching all of the texts. Let me know if you have any problems.
Sept. 1, 1995 -- The new page design that I had been working on

and made the plays a bit more attractive.
July 12, 1995 -- Round two of the new formatting is
done. Please
let me know what you think. If I don't find any further problems, I
plan to convert all of the texts by the end of the month.

Romeo and Juliet
Henry V
The Merchant of Venice

quotes from

Familiar Quotations

Frequently Asked Questions

HTML3 home page.

all of the plays, but not the poems.
