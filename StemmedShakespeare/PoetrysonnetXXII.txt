sonnet xxii sonnet xxii my glass shall not persuad me i am old so long as youth and thou are of one date but when in thee time furrow i behold then look i death my day should expiat for all that beauti that doth cover thee is but the seem raiment of my heart which in thi breast doth live as thine in me how can i then be elder than thou art o therefor love be of thyself so wari as i not for myself but for thee will bear thi heart which i will keep so chari as tender nurs her babe from fare ill presum not on thi heart when mine is slain thou gavest me thine not to give back again
