sonnet lxxiii sonnet lxxiii that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leav or none or few do hang upon those bough which shake against the cold bare ruin'd choir where late the sweet bird sang in me thou seest the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west which by and by black night doth take away death second self that seal up all in rest in me thou see'st the glow of such fire that on the ash of his youth doth lie as the deathb whereon it must expir consum with that which it was nourish'd by this thou perceivest which make thi love more strong to love that well which thou must leav ere long
