sonnet cxix sonnet cxix what potion have i drunk of siren tear distill'd from limbeck foul as hell within appli fear to hope and hope to fear still lose when i saw myself to win what wretch error hath my heart commit whilst it hath thought itself so bless never how have mine eye out of their sphere been fit in the distract of this mad fever o benefit of ill now i find true that better is by evil still made better and ruin'd love when it is built anew grow fairer than at first more strong far greater so i return rebuk to my content and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent
